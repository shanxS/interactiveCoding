# interactiveCoding

### end goal
to use voice cmd for programming. primary intent was to augment programming with voice cmds.

### current state of project
Fairly functional, can perform cmd line task execution. But you'll have to setup alexa, lambda function and sqs.

### further dev
Giving up on this, partially becuase I found something else intersting to work on 
and partially because other mature solutions exist: like voiceCode and vocola.
They both are using Dragon (paid, probably offline speech to text) as opposed to this project using Alexa.
